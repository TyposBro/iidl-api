# {PATH_TO_THE_PROJECT}/.cd-manifest/deploy.yaml
# --- Configuration for the Node.js API Deployment ---
# NOTE: This version is configured for LOCAL TESTING.
# Before committing to Git for production, you MUST:
# 1. Change 'image:' to the full registry path and production version tag.
# 2. Change 'imagePullPolicy:' to 'Always' or remove it.
# 3. Ensure 'secretKeyRef.name' and 'secretKeyRef.key' point to the PRODUCTION secret name and keys.
